**Note:** RoleMark is being **rebuilt from scratch**. The first version shipped and has since been archived; the current repository is a ground-up rewrite on a new stack, carrying forward the product thesis below.

**Project Overview:**
RoleMark is built around a simple idea: every role deserves the right resume. Job seekers upload a resume and job description to get an instant compatibility score with actionable feedback, then generate role-specific resume versions tuned for ATS systems and hiring managers. The product also includes AI-assisted cover letters, a rich editing experience, and workflow tools to stay organized across applications.

## Objectives

1. **Fast, honest fit scoring** — Give users a clear read on how well a resume matches a job description in seconds, with suggestions they can act on.
2. **Tailored outputs** — Produce versions of a resume aligned to a specific role without starting from scratch each time.
3. **End-to-end job search support** — Combine scoring, tailoring, cover letters, and organization (companies, versions) in one product.
4. **Sustainable SaaS** — Subscription and one-time purchase options, with a clear free tier for discovery.

## Features

1. **AI resume scoring** — Upload a resume and job description for an instant compatibility score and detailed feedback.
2. **Resume tailoring** — Generate role-specific resume versions optimized for ATS parsing and relevance.
3. **Cover letter generation** — AI-generated cover letters with tone customization.
4. **Rich text editor** — WYSIWYG editing with inline AI assistance.
5. **Version management** — Track multiple versions of resumes over time.
6. **Company organization** — Group and manage applications by company.
7. **Command bar** — Spotlight-style search (Cmd+K) for quick navigation across the app.

## The Rebuild

The first version was a Next.js App Router app on Supabase with Stripe billing and a Tiptap-based editor. It proved the product out, but accumulated enough structural debt that extending it cost more than restarting. The rewrite trades that foundation for a lighter, faster one and keeps the parts that earned their place.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** TanStack Start with TanStack Router (file-based routing, generated route tree)
- **UI:** React 19, TypeScript
- **Build & tooling:** Vite, Bun, oxlint, oxfmt
- **AI:** LLM-backed scoring, tailoring, and cover letter generation

## Outcome

_The original version shipped with AI scoring, paid tailoring and cover-letter flows, and integrated billing. That codebase is now archived and the product is being rebuilt on a new foundation._
