**Note:** This is a real project that I worked on at Visa, so many details are omitted or generalized to maintain confidentiality.

**Project Overview:**
BI Secretary is an application that enables NLQ (natural language querying) analytics on critical Visa business data and provides insights to business users all through a conversational interface. By leveraging advanced NLP (natural language processing) techniques, BI Secretary allows users to interact with data in a more intuitive and conversational manner, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries or data visualization tools. The application is designed to democratize data access and empower business users to make informed decisions based on real-time data insights.

## Objectives

1. Create a conversational interface for querying and analyzing Visa business data.
2. Store and process large volumes of data securely and efficiently using internal Visa data platforms.

## Features

1. **Natural Language Querying:**

   - Enable users to ask questions and receive answers in natural language.
   - Support a wide range of queries related to business metrics, trends, and performance.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Generate visualizations, charts, and graphs based on user queries using internal Visa data visualization tools and React components.
   - Provide interactive dashboards for exploring data and identifying patterns.

## Technology Stack

> I was responsible for building the UI, but the applications full stack is as follows

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Zustand, Internal Visa UI Library
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, proprietary Visa data processing tools
- **Database:** Apache Hadoop, Apache Hive, Apache HBase (all managed by Visa's internal data platform)

## Outcome

BI Secretary was successfully deployed to Visa's internal business users, who found the application intuitive and user-friendly. The conversational interface allowed users to interact with data more naturally, reducing the learning curve associated with traditional data querying tools. The application received positive feedback for its ease of use, real-time insights, and ability to democratize data access within the organization.
